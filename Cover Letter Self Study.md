## Cover Letter (Self Study)
This lesson will help students understand the purpose of a cover letter, and how to craft one that will catch the attention of employers.  Students should have their “Star Stories” ready for use in this document.

A cover letter can serve many of the same purposes of a resume.  Though this practice dates back to when hard-copy application materials would be submitted for a job application, many still request that they be included.  Failing to follow instructions on a job application, or passing on any opportunity to show off your skills and qualifications, can be detrimental to your success!

## Discussion Questions
- What is the purpose of a cover letter?
- How can a cover letter set you apart from other applicants?
- Should you even bother with a cover letter?  Why or why not?



## How-to Steps
- Format the heading of your cover letter the same way you’ve formatted the heading of your resume.  This all ties in with your overall branding.
- Try to find the name of the hiring manager to address in the greeting of your letter.  Your networking will come in handy here!  Address your letter to that manager by first name.  
- If you can’t find the name of the hiring manager for the position, openings such as “Dear Hiring Manager” are preferable to the more formal “To Whom It May Concern.”
- The first part/paragraph of your letter is a great place to reference the position, express interest, and show any general research you’ve done on the organization and position.
- The second section/paragraph is the meat of the letter.  Here is where you show off your experience, skills, and accomplishments, specifically addressing the desired requirements in the posting.  
- The “T” format cover letter is a great way to do this in a way that hiring managers can quickly find and review.  This makes your second paragraph a chart, directly comparing your qualifications to their requirements.
- Your third and final paragraph should recap your overall interest and ability, and always include a call to action!  Let the hiring manager know how to reach you, and ask them to get in touch!  


## Things to Avoid
- Exceeding one page in length
- Grammatical and spelling errors
- Lying (this includes exaggeration)
- Outdated formalities (To Whom It May Concern, Dear Mr./Ms. etc.)
- Failing to tailor your cover letter to the position you are applying for.  Make sure that you choose examples from their list of requirements (if available) and that you examples fit the role.
- Forgetting to show what you can do to help the company.  You’re an asset!  Make sure they can clearly see that from you application materials.
